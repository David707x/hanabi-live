+------+

- try refactoring to unknown: const subscriptions: Array<Subscription<State, any>> = [];
- remove type assertions from sudoku.ts (need feedback from Ram)
- PlayerIndex type (maybe, look to see if it is useful first)
- CardOrder type (branded)
- redo install instructions without choco
- refactor START_CARD_RANK from 7 --> 0 (might affect database?)
- remove all type assertions from src/game/reducers + src/game/rules (use eslint rule to find)

search for all:
- "for (let"
- brand card order type

short term:
- refactor soundTypeForLastAction (should probably delete the whole thing)
- getPlayerNames comma is in wrong place for 3+ players
- move "build_client.sh" and "esbuild_dev.sh" out of "client" directory
- get rid of all identity functions in "packages/client/src/game/rules/variant.ts"
- search for "This message is unnecessary"
- search for "TODO: remove. This is unused"
- refactor `ignoreNegative`, I don't think it should be created inside of the reducer

medium term:
- custom 404 page

long term once the server is rewritten in TypeScript:
- change server WebSocket authentication style: https://github.com/Hanabi-Live/hanabi-live/issues/2845
  - once this is done, we don't have to use client-side cookies anymore, can remove `@fastify/secure-session` dep entirely
  - will also have to generate argon2 hash on client side so that the hash can be stored in local storage
- delete "metadata" table from "database_schema.sql" + "test_key" thing
- refactor chat_log to have foreign key for user_id + boolean for server message
- refactor ActionNoteList to be one array of objects instead of multiple arrays (and the other various note things)
- refactor `order` --> `cardOrder`
