TODO:

- refactor soundTypeForLastAction (should probably delete the whole thing)
- getPlayerNames comma is in wrong place for 3+ players
- move "build_client.sh" and "esbuild_dev.sh" out of "client" directory
- get rid of all identity functions in "packages/client/src/game/rules/variant.ts"
- search for "TODO: This message is unnecessary and will be removed in a future version of the code"
- search for "TODO: remove. This is unused"
- refactor `ignoreNegative`, I don't think it should be created inside of the reducer

old stuff:
- rename colorCluesTouchNothing
- rename rankCluesTouchNothing
- rename all specialX properties
- rename all variant properties based on order in variants.md
- make VariantJSON extend from VariantDescription
