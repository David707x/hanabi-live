+------+

short term:
- refactor soundTypeForLastAction (should probably delete the whole thing)
- getPlayerNames comma is in wrong place for 3+ players
- move "build_client.sh" and "esbuild_dev.sh" out of "client" directory
- get rid of all identity functions in "packages/client/src/game/rules/variant.ts"
- search for "TODO: This message is unnecessary and will be removed in a future version of the code"
- search for "TODO: remove. This is unused"
- refactor `ignoreNegative`, I don't think it should be created inside of the reducer

medium term:
- custom 404 page
- custom 500 page

long term once the server is rewritten in TypeScript:
- change server WebSocket authentication style: https://github.com/Hanabi-Live/hanabi-live/issues/2845
- delete "metadata" table from "database_schema.sql" + "test_key" thing
- refactor chat_log to have foreign key for user_id + boolean for server message
