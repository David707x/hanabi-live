TODO:

- refactor soundTypeForLastAction (should probably delete the whole thing)
- getPlayerNames comma is in wrong place for 3+ players
- move "build_client.sh" and "esbuild_dev.sh" out of "client" directory
- is it desired to put `showSuitName` prop on `Suit` object? look into dynamically calculating
  whether or not suit names are shown in client code rather than looking at the variant prop

old stuff:
- rename colorCluesTouchNothing
- rename rankCluesTouchNothing
- rename all specialX properties
- rename all variant properties based on order in VARIANTS.md
- make VariantJSON extend from VariantDescription
